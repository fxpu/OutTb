# OutTb
Output Textbox - A simple windows Textbox to view redirected output or the clipboard

With this small Windows tool you can display the content of a file, redirected output or the clipboard in a TextBox. For me as a screenreader user this is a good solution to have a fast way of navigating through text output.

# Usage
- To view a file OutTb.exe <file-name>
- To redirect std out: dir | ReTb.exe
- To view the current clipboard text: outTb.exe
